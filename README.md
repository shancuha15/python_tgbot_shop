- Collect user information. When you press the "start" button, the information is entered into the database of "botusers",
necessary for its further use in product update mailing lists, store news and other improving the quality of the bot and the store.

![botusers](https://github.com/shancuha15/python_tgbot_shop/blob/main/readme%20photo/botusers.png)

- Send important information to users. The message comes in the bot itself. The administrator enters the "/reminder" command,
after which the bot reads the message that is in the reminder.txt file and sends it to all users. Another
Users entering this command will receive an error notification. The "reminder" function, which is located in
main.py file. Convenient because you do not need to stop the program to change the text, but simply change the text
in the reminder.txt file and write the "/reminder" command.
